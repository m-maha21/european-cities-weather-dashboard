# Weather Dashboard App

## European Cities Weather Dashboard

## Description

The Weather Dashboard project aims to create a web application that provides users with current weather information and forecasts for cities worldwide. Users can search for a specific city, and the dashboard will dynamically display relevant weather data retrieved from an external weather API. The project will utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface and handle data fetching and rendering.
